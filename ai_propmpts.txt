Prompt Chain Summary:

1. Initial Assistant Guidance:
- Asked to implement an AI NPC chat system with per-player chat history, mood tracking, and LLM-powered replies.
- Discussed processing player messages chronologically, maintaining last 3 messages per player, and dynamic mood updates.

2. Mood Classification Prompt:
- Combined recent conversation history (last 3 messages) and latest player message.
- Prompt to classify player mood into: friendly, angry, or neutral.
- Used a direct instruction to answer with one mood label only.

3. Suggested Enhancement to Classification:
- Modify prompt to output structured JSON containing:
   {
     "mood": "friendly" | "angry" | "neutral",
     "intensity": "mild" | "moderate" | "strong",
     "reason": "<brief explanation why>"
   }
- Benefits: richer mood tracking, explainability, detailed logs.

4. NPC Reply Generation Prompt:
- System prompt describes NPC mood and style instructions.
- Includes recent conversation context.
- Asks model to generate short, context- and mood-aware NPC dialogue.

5. Code Refinement and Best Practices:
- Structured code with docstrings, consistent formatting, and comments.
- Robust error handling with fallback defaults.
- Use of pythonic data structures (defaultdict, deque) for state management.
- Logging includes mood, intensity, reason, full conversation snippet, and timestamps.

6. Final Notes:
- Prompt chaining approaches helped break complex tasks into manageable subtasks (mood classification and reply generation).
- Emphasized clarity and structured output for integration and debugging.
